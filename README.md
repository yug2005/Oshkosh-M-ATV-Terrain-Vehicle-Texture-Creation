# Oshkosh M-ATV Terrain Vehicle Texture Creation

## Summary 

This texture creation project in Adobe Substance Painter contains the main *Adobe Substance Painter 3D Project* (`.spp`) file and the texture sets created for the 3D model of the Oshkosh M-ATV Terrain Vehicle. 

Note : The texture sets were exported for Unreal Engine 4 and the emissive texture map was excluded as the final model did not have any emissive textures.

## Contents

The following details the content of the files and folders. 

### Project Images

This folder contains preview images of the project. 

### Texture Sets

This folder only contains the folder "Unreal Engine 4" which contains the texture set of the model for use in Unreal Engine 4. For each of the five material sets, there are *basecolor*, *normal*, and *ORM* (occlusion, roughness, and metallic maps are masked within the RGB channels) texture maps in `.png` format (4k resolution). 

### Vehicle

This is the main *Adobe Substance Painter 3D Project* (`.spp`) file. It can be opened with recent versions of Adobe Substance Painter. 

Note : This is a large file over 10 GB as it contains high resolution bakes. Therefore, it is not currently in the repository.
